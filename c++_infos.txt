(1). If you create a copy constructor, the default constructor will no longer be provided by the compiler, so you have to impelement it yourself.
(2). the implicit copy constructor of the compiler performs a shallow copy, wich is copying the values of the other object to the new one (this),
	 so if you have a dinamic allocated data, the members of the two objects will point to the same memory, and that is dangerous.
(3). Deep copy is possible only with a user-defined copy constructor.
(4). there is two ways to kall copy constructor, the most known is : MyClass a(existing_object); but there is another way, wich is : MyClass a = existing_object;
	 this may seem like the assignement operator but it is actually a copy constructor, cuase object a dokesn't exist yet so the compiler calls the copy constructor to create it.
(5). About inheritance:
	 * a public inheritance keeps all the members of the parent class the same, private = private, protected = protected, public = public.
	 * a private inheritance makes the public and the protected members private, and the private is inaccessible.
	 * a protected inheritance keeps the protected and private as they are, and the public becoms protected.
