# 42 C++ Projects

This repository contains my solutions for the **C++ modules** from the [42 Network](https://42.fr/) curriculum.  
The projects gradually build up from simple exercises to more advanced C++ concepts, reinforcing object-oriented programming and modern C++ practices.

## 📚 Projects Included
- **Module 00** – Basics of C++, namespaces, classes, member functions  
- **Module 01** – Memory allocation, references, pointers  
- **Module 02** – Ad-hoc polymorphism, operator overloading  
- **Module 03** – Inheritance and abstract classes  
- **Module 04** – Subtype polymorphism, abstract classes, interfaces  
- **Module 05** – Exception handling  
- **Module 06** – Casts and type conversion  
- **Module 07** – Templates  
- **Module 08** – Templated containers, iterators, algorithms  

## 🛠️ Requirements
- Compiler: `c++` with flags `-Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`  
- Linux or macOS environment (tested at 42 school machines)

## 📌 Notes
Each module is organized in its own folder with a `Makefile` for building.  
The code follows the **42 Norm** (coding style rules).
